Sample type,Action,Comment
,,
5m Under ice 10m NET,,"Should be split into depth (5m), gear (type of net) & sample type (??)"
5m Under ice VivaFlow,,"Should be split into depth (5m), gear (Viva Flow) & sample type (??)"
5m Under ice VivaFlow + IMR1/2,,"Should be split into depth (5m), gear (Viva Flow) & sample type (??) Luka: it´s a water sample concentrated using VivaFlow/Net (what is concentrated of course is protist/phytoplankton cells).  The net was 10µm plankton net"
